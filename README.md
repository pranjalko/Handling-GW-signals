# Handling-GW-signals



I uploaded the dataset (https://github.com/astroclubiitk/Hyperion-2022) on csv file and then 
uploaded it in google colab (python) , colab file.

I first made a plot of all three datasets and the proceeded to remove noises from it, for removing noises I used a low pass filter and it resulted in somewhat better plots with lesser noise.

I then calculated time period by picking two points on signal.
